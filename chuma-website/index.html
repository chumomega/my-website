                            <h3>About Me</h3>

                            <p>I am an ambitious Nigerian American scholar. Currently, I am in the process of acquiring my B.S in Computer Science at CUNY - Brooklyn College. I am a skilled software developer with experience in multiple languages across the development process. In addition to development, I am adept in explaining myself. This is part of why I have had much success in tutoring. Lastly, I have an entrepreneur side to myself. Ever since I was a teenager, I have taken part in the sneaker reselling market. </p>

                            <h3>Web & Software Development</h3>

                            <p>I have hands on development experience in various different languages. This includes front end languages like CSS and JavaScript, back end languages like Java and C++, and even SQL to interact with relational databases. I have used these languages in the business world, in advanced school projects, at hackathons, and even for personal projects. You can see some of my work in the "Projects" portion of this website.

                            <p>Growing up with my 6 siblings under one roof, I have had countless chances to practice explaining myself. This plays a big role on why I have had success working in groups with people that have differing opinions. I have always been able to explain a point, whether it be to a group or one-on-one.</p>
