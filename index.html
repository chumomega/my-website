                            <p>I am an ambitious Nigerian American Software Engineer. The foundation of 
                                my Computer Science knowledge comes from my Bachelor of Science at Brooklyn 
                                College. Using that as a starting point I utilized online tools like Udemy, 
                                hackathons, internships, and personal projects to strengthen fundamental 
                                skills. Some of my hobbies include going to parks, playing sports like basketball 
                                and handball, watching podcasts, and playing mobile games.

                            <h3>Software Engineering</h3>

                            <p>From tech companies like Mastercard and Justworks, personal projects, 
                                hackathons, and school; I have gained a plethora of experience in the Software 
                                Engineering field. This includes front end languages/technologies like HTML, 
                                CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular and back end languages/technologies like C++, Java, 
                                SpringBoot, Ruby on Rails, and Express. I also have experience with SQL for 
                                relational databases, Git for version control, and test driven development. 
                                All of this and more are just tools in my toolkit for when I need them to solve a particular problem.
